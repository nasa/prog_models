    "The goal of this notebook is to instruct users on how to use and extend the NASA PCoE Python Prognostics Model Package. \n",
    "\n",
    "First some background. The Prognostics Model Package is a python package for the modeling and simulation of the evolution of state for components, systems, and systems of systems, with a focus on simulating specific events. When used for prognostics, these events are typically system failures, such as a winding failure on a motor or full discharge of a battery. \n",
    "\n",
    "A few definitions:\n",
    "* __Event__: Something that can be predicted (e.g., system failure, warning threshold). An event has either occurred or not. \n",
    "* __Event State__: Progress towards event occurring. Defined as a number where an event state of 0 indicates the event has occurred and 1 indicates no progress towards the event (i.e., fully healthy operation for a failure event). For gradually occurring events (e.g., discharge) the number will progress from 1 to 0 as the event nears. In prognostics, event state is frequently called \"State of Health\" or \"SOH\"\n",
    "* __Inputs__: Control applied to the system being modeled (e.g., current drawn from a battery)\n",
    "* __Outputs__: Measured sensor values from a system (e.g., voltage and temperature of a battery), outputs can be estimated from system state\n",
    "* __States__: Internal parameters (typically hidden states) used to represent the state of the system- can be same as inputs/outputs but do not have to be. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `prog_models` package has the following structure\n",
    "* `prog_models.PrognosticsModel` - parent class for all prognostics models - defines interfaces that a model must implement, and tools for simulating said model \n",
    "* `prog_models.models.*` - implemented models (e.g., pump, valve, battery)\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the `prog_models` package, this repo includes many examples illustrating how to use the package (see `examples/`), a template for implementing a new model (`prog_model_template`), documentation (`https://nasa.github.io/prog_models`), and this tutorial (`tutorial.ipynb`).\n",
    "\n",
