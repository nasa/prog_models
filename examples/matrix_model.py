Example demonstrating using matrix input, states, and outputs in models

.. dropdown:: More details

    This example shows the use of the advanced feature - matrix models. Matrix models represent the state of the system using matrices instead of dictionaries. The provided model.StateContainer, InputContainer, and OutputContainer can be treated as dictionaries but use an underlying matrix. This is important for some applications like surrogate and machine-learned models where the state is represented by a tensor, and operations by matrix operations. Simulation functions propagate the state using the matrix form, preventing the inefficiency of having to convert to and from dictionaries.

    In this example, a model is designed to simulate a thrown object using matrix notation (instead of dictionary notation as in the standard model). The implementation of the model is comparable to a standard model, except that it uses the x.matrix, u.matrix, and z.matrix to compute matrix operations within each function.
