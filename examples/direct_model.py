"""
This example demonstrates the Direct Models functionality. Direct models are models that directly estimate time of event from system state, rather than using state transition. This is useful for data-driven models that map from sensor data to time of event, and for physics-based models where state transition differential equations can be solved.

Here a DirectThrownObject model is defined, extending the ThrownObject state transition model from the new_model example. This model is then initialized and used to estimate the time of event from the initial state.

    # Step 1: Define DirectModel
    # In this case we're extending the ThrownObject model to include the  time_to_event method, defined in DirectModel
    # In the case of thrown objects, we can solve the differential equation 
    # to estimate the time at which the events occur.
    class DirectThrownObject(ThrownObject):
        def time_of_event(self, x, *args, **kwargs):
            # calculate time when object hits ground given x['x'] and x['v']
            # 0 = x0 + v0*t - 0.5*g*t^2

            return {'falling': t_falling, 'impact': t_impact}

    # Note that adding *args and **kwargs is optional.
    # Having these arguments makes the function interchangeable with other models
    # which might have arguments or keyword arguments

    # Step 2: Now estimate time of event for a ThrownObject
    m = DirectThrownObject()
    x = m.initialize()  # Using Initial state
    # Now instead of simulating to threshold, we can estimate it directly from the state, like so

    # Notice that execution is MUCH faster for the direct model. 
    # This is even more pronounced for events that occur later in the simulation.

    # In this case, the DirectThrownObject has a defined next_state and output equation, 
    # allowing it to be used with a state estimator (e..g, Particle Filter)

# This allows the module to be executed directly
