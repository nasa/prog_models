This example shows the use of the LinearModel class, a subclass of PrognosticsModel for models that can be described as a linear time series. 

The model is used in a simulation, and the state is printed every second

    ------------
        process_noise : Optional, float or dict[Srt, float]
          Process noise (applied at dx/next_state). 
          Can be number (e.g., .2) applied to every state, a dictionary of values for each 
          state (e.g., {'x1': 0.2, 'x2': 0.3}), or a function (x) -> x
        process_noise_dist : Optional, str
          distribution for process noise (e.g., normal, uniform, triangular)
        measurement_noise : Optional, float or dict[Srt, float]
          Measurement noise (applied in output eqn).

          output (e.g., {'z1': 0.2, 'z2': 0.3}), or a function (z) -> z
        measurement_noise_dist : Optional, str
          distribution for measurement noise (e.g., normal, uniform, triangular)
        g : Optional, float
            Acceleration due to gravity (m/s^2). Default is 9.81 m/s^2 (standard gravity)
        thrower_height : Optional, float
            Height of the thrower (m). Default is 1.83 m
        throwing_speed : Optional, float
            Speed at which the ball is thrown (m/s). Default is 40 m/s
