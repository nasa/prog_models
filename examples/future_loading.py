    ## Example 1: Variable loading 
    def future_loading(t, x=None):
        # Variable (piece-wise) future loading scheme 
        if (t < 600):
            i = 2
        elif (t < 900):
            i = 1
        elif (t < 1800):
            i = 4
        elif (t < 3000):
            i = 2     
        else:
            i = 3
        return m.InputContainer({'i': i})
    
    # Simulate to threshold
    options = {
        'save_freq': 100,  # Frequency at which results are saved
        'dt': 2  # Timestep
    }

    # Now lets plot the inputs and event_states
    simulated_results.inputs.plot(ylabel = 'Variable Load Current (amps)', xlabel='time (s)')
    simulated_results.event_states.plot(ylabel = 'Variable Load Event State', xlabel='time (s)')

    ## Example 2: Moving Average loading 
    # This is useful in cases where you are running reoccuring simulations, and are measuring the actual load on the system, 
    # but don't have a good way of predicting it, and you expect loading to be steady

    from prog_models.loading import MovingAverage

    future_loading = MovingAverage(m.InputContainer)

    # Now lets say you have some measured loads to add
    measured_loads = [10, 11.5, 12.0, 8, 2.1, 1.8, 1.99, 2.0, 2.01, 1.89, 1.92, 2.01, 2.1, 2.2]
    
    # We're going to feed these into the future loading eqn
    for load in measured_loads:
        future_loading.add_load({'i': load})
    
    # Now the future_loading eqn is setup to use the moving average of whats been seen
    # Simulate to threshold
    simulated_results = m.simulate_to_threshold(future_loading, **options)

    # Now lets plot the inputs and event_states
    simulated_results.inputs.plot(ylabel = 'Moving Average Current (amps)', xlabel='time (s)')
    simulated_results.event_states.plot(ylabel = 'Moving Average Event State', xlabel='time (s)')

    # In this case, this estimate is wrong because loading will not be steady, but at least it would give you an approximation.

    # If more measurements are received, the user could estimate the moving average here and then run a new simulation. 

    ## Example 3: Gaussian Distribution 
    # In this example we will still be doing a variable loading like the first option, but we are going to use a 
    # gaussian distribution for each input.

        else:
