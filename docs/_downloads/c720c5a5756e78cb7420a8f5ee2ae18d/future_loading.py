    ## Example 1: Variable loading 
    def future_loading(t, x=None):
        # Variable (piece-wise) future loading scheme 
        if (t < 600):
            i = 2
        elif (t < 900):
            i = 1
        elif (t < 1800):
            i = 4
        elif (t < 3000):
            i = 2     
        else:
            i = 3
        return {'i': i}
    # Simulate to threshold
    options = {
        'save_freq': 100, # Frequency at which results are saved
        'dt': 2 # Timestep
    }
    (times, inputs, states, outputs, event_states) = m.simulate_to_threshold(future_loading, {'t': 18.95, 'v': 4.183}, **options)

    # Now lets plot the inputs and event_states
    input_fig = plot_timeseries(times, inputs, options={'ylabel': 'Variable Load Current (amps)'})
    event_states_fig = plot_timeseries(times, event_states, options={'ylabel': 'Variable Load Event State'})

    ## Example 2: Moving Average loading 
    # This is useful in cases where you are running reoccuring simulations, and are measuring the actual load on the system, 
    # but dont have a good way of predicting it, and you expect loading to be steady

    def future_loading(t, x=None):
        return future_loading.load
    future_loading.load = {key : 0 for key in m.inputs} 

    # Lets define another function to handle the moving average logic
    window = 10 # Number of elements in window
    def moving_avg(i):
        for key in m.inputs:
            moving_avg.loads[key].append(i[key])
            if len(moving_avg.loads[key]) > window:
                del moving_avg.loads[key][0] # Remove first item

        # Update future loading eqn
        future_loading.load = {key : mean(moving_avg.loads[key]) for key in m.inputs} 
    moving_avg.loads = {key : [] for key in m.inputs} 

    # OK, we've setup the logic of the moving average. 
    # Now lets say you have some measured loads to add
    measured_loads = [10, 11.5, 12.0, 8, 2.1, 1.8, 1.99, 2.0, 2.01, 1.89, 1.92, 2.01, 2.1, 2.2]
    
    # We're going to feed these into the future loading eqn
    for load in measured_loads:
        moving_avg({'i': load})
    
    # Now the future_loading eqn is setup to use the moving average of whats been seen
    # Simulate to threshold
    (times, inputs, states, outputs, event_states) = m.simulate_to_threshold(future_loading, {'t': 18.95, 'v': 4.183}, **options)

    # Now lets plot the inputs and event_states
    input_fig = plot_timeseries(times, inputs, options={'ylabel': 'Moving Average Current (amps)'})
    event_states_fig = plot_timeseries(times, event_states, options={'ylabel': 'Moving Average Event State'})

    # In this case, this estimate is wrong because loading will not be steady, but at least it would give you an approximation. 
    # Users should adjust noise accordingly

    # If more measurements are received, the user could estimate the moving average here and then run a new simulation. 

    ## Example 3: Gaussian Distribution 
    # In this example we will still be doing a variable loading like the first option, but we are going to use a 
    # gaussian distribution for each input.

            i = 2

    # Example 4: Gaussian- increasing with time
    # For this we're using moving average. This is realistic because the further out from current time you get, 
    # the more uncertainty there is in your prediction.
