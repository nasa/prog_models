    "The goal of this notebook is to instruct users on how to use and extend the NASA PCoE Python Prognostics Model Package. \n",
    "\n",
    "First some background. The Prognostics Model Package is a python package for the modeling and simulation of the evolution of state for physical components, with a focus on simulating specific events. When used for prognostics, these events are typically system failures, such as a winding failure on a motor or full discharge of a battery. \n",
    "\n",
    "A few definitions:\n",
    "* events: some state that can be predicted (e.g., system failure). An event has either occured or not. \n",
    "* event state: progress towards event occuring. Defined as a number where an event state of 0 indicates the event has occured and 1 indicates no progress towards the event (i.e., fully healthy operation for a failure event). For gradually occuring events (e.g., discharge) the number will progress from 1 to 0 as the event nears. In prognostics, event state is frequently called \"State of Health\"\n",
    "* inputs: control applied to the system being modeled (e.g., current drawn from a battery)\n",
    "* outputs: measured sensor values from a system (e.g., voltage and temperature of a battery)\n",
    "* states: Internal parameters (typically hidden states) used to represent the state of the system- can be same as inputs/outputs but do not have to be. \n",
    "* process noise: stochastic process representing uncertainty in the model transition. \n",
    "* measurement noise: stochastic process representing uncertainty in the measurement process; e.g., sensor sensitivity, sensor misalignements, environmental effects \n",
    "\n",
    "The `prog_models` package has the following structure\n",
    "* `prog_models.PrognosticsModel` - parent class for all prognostics models - defines interfaces that a model must implement, and tools for simulating said model \n",
    "* `prog_models.models.*` - implemented models (e.g., pump, valve, battery)\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the `prog_models` package, this repo includes examples showing how to use the package (see `examples/`), a template for implementing a new model (`prog_model_template`), documentation (`docs/`), and this tutorial (`tutorial.ipynb`).\n",
