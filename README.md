The NASA Prognostic Model Package is a Python framework focused on defining and building models for prognostics (computation of remaining useful life) of engineering systems, and provides a set of prognostics models for select components developed within this framework, suitable for use in prognostics applications for these components.

This is part of the wider Prognostics Python Packages (ProgPy) and is designed to be used with the [Prognostics Algorithms Package](https://github.com/nasa/prog_algs).

## Installation 
`pip3 install prog_models`

## Contributing Organizations
ProgPy was created by a partnership of multiple organizations, working together to build a set of high-quality prognostic tools for the wider PHM Community. We would like to give a big thank you for the ProgPy community, especially the following contributing organizations:

* [NASA's Diagnostics and Prognostics Group](https://www.nasa.gov/content/diagnostics-prognostics)
* German Aerospace Center (DLR)
* Northrop Grumman Corporation (NGC)
* Vanderbilt University

## Acknowledgements
The structure and algorithms of this package are strongly inspired by the [MATLAB Prognostics Model Library](https://github.com/nasa/PrognosticsModelLibrary). We would like to recognize Matthew Daigle and the rest of the team that contributed to the Prognostics Model Library for the contributions their work on the MATLAB library made to the design of prog_models.
