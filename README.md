# Prognostics Model Python Package

The NASA Prognostic Model Package is a python modeling framework focused on defining and building models for prognostics (computation of remaining useful life) of engineering systems, and provides a set of prognostics models for select components developed within this framework, suitable for use in prognostics applications for these components.

This is designed to be used with the [Prognostics Algorithms Package](https://github.com/nasa/prog_algs).

## Acknowledgements
The structure and algorithms of this package are strongly inspired by the [MATLAB Prognostics Model Library](https://github.com/nasa/PrognosticsModelLibrary). We would like to recognize Matthew Daigle and the rest of the team that contributed to the Prognostics Model Library for the contributions their work on the MATLAB library made to the design of prog_models
