    Generate control allocation matrix (CAM) to transform rotor's angular velocity into thrust and torques around three main body axes.

    Where:
        [T, Mx, My, Mz]^{\top} is the (4 x 1) column vector containing thrust (T) and moments along main body axis (Mx, My, Mz)
        \Gamma is the (4 x n) CAM
        [\Omega_1^2, \Omega_2^2, ..., \Omega_n^2]^{\top} is the (n x 1) column vector of the rotor angular speed squared.

    The control allocation matrix is built under the assumption of symmetric rotor configuration, for generality.
    Special CAM should be built ad-hoc per UAV model.
