        The data would start by looking like:
            [{'x': 2.83}, {'x': 22.83}, {'x': 40.3775}, {'x': 55.4725}, {'x': 68.115}, ...]
        Then would be transformed to something like:
            [[2.83, 0.0], [22.83, 0.5], [40.3775, 1.0], [55.4725, 1.5], [68.115, 2.0], ...]
        
        Note that the helper function also adds 'time' to each of the indices to account for any data that may not necessarily be 
        recorded at a consistent rate.
